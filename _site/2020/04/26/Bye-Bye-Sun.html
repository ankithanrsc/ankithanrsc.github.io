				<h2>Bye Bye Sun!</h2>
				<p>Ankitha, 26 April 2020</p>
			</header><div>
<p>After completing the operations, it was time for the ship to depart from Bharati. We bid our goodbyes to the last of friends leaving by voyage. And as it sailed away in the waters of Antarctic ocean, the reality started to sink in, that we are all left alone together in this vast continent that would be cut off from the rest of the world for the winter. Nothing is going to get us to mainland, atleast for the coming 7 months. And as this feeling grew upon us, most of us sat together in the corridor, making fun out of our remoteness. We talked and laughed, while I realized that these are the people that would be my expedition team no matter what comes. These are the faces, the only people I will get to see, talk and explore the landscape around us with. These are the ones I would call my winter team when I get back to the mainland.</p>

<p>There was excitement in the team to do some intresting things and capture the memories. We tried to keep ourselves busy with music, playing TT and other board games, watching movies post-dinner, preparing intresting dishes, making experiments, venturing out, accompanying friends on their outing for work..., etc. </p>

<p>Ohh and did I mention the penguins? Well they are just WOW! The two species of penguins sighted in the Larsemann Hills are Adelie and Emporer penguins. Adelie is the most widely spread penguin species and is common along the entire coast of Antarctica.  "They are extraordinarily like children, these little people of the Antarctic world, either like children or like old men, full of their own importance", said Cherry-Garrard in his book 'The Worst Journey in the World.' And they are a delight that comes with its own packet of happiness. These penguins are mid-sized, being 46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 in) in height.</p>

<p>Emporer penguins, on the other hand are the largest of all the living species penguins reaching a  height of 122cm (48in). It is the only species that breeds during the harsh winters of Antarctica. Breeding nature of penguins is sensitive. And to breed in winters, is a great challenge for emporers. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0036tyc">Here is an intresting clip from BBC Planet documentary series.</a> The penguins march for 50-120 km on ice to breeding colonies where gatherings are upto severals of thousands of emporers.  Cherry-Garrard, the Antarctic explorer, wrote in 1922: "Take it all in all, I do not believe anybody on Earth has a worse time than an emperor penguin"</p>

<p>After all, they aint just cute! They are much more than that.</p>


<p>Larsemann Hills happened to be on their way to the rookery, a breeding colony. And we had the brief but captivating moments of witnessing a group of around 29-32 natives waddle on their feet and toboggan (or slide) on their bellies. It was already 11th of April, 2018, when the ship left. And nights were, by then, longer than days. and auroras had already become part of our night wonders. Many times, I remember people abandoning the movie as soon as the news of aurora came in. We also celebrated few birthdays and anniversaries and some of them ended up with an aurora wishing from above.</p>

<p>With each day, the duration of day kept reducing bringing us a day closer to polar nights. And polar nights pose challenges for work outside the station. Hence it was necessary to plan and finish some work before we glide into days of endless darkness. And that included few shramdaans. Sunlight slowly became precious for us. And it made me realize, how we fail to appreciate and take for granted the simple things in life just because we didnt have to struggle for it. We went up to the terrace and around the station, to catch a glimpse at the sun before his vacation. And then, on 26th or 27th of May, it was time for the sun to take leave, it was the day of last sunrise. Ahh!! The inportance he had that day! The sunrise and sunset were only about a few minutes apart. That day, the sun would rise and set at North (almost), and sunlight wasnt coming from above anymore, it was coming from near horizon, it was coming from just above the sea, barging into the corridors and lighting them up in a different hue of golden. And not much later, the sun had set.</p>

<p>Thats it. Thats when our polar nights started.</p>
