And down the journey, we started to see some little structures in white and blue shine on the sea. We were wondering what they were until we realized they were icebergs. Then came more ice and then, an announcement, we have 1.5 hour before landing and got to gear up to step on ice. 1 hour before landing, everyone started wearing their polar gears, all excited for what lay ahead. The polar gear is not an easy dressup, particularly for first timers. I...</p><a href="/2019/06/16/from-novo-to-maitri.html">read more</a></div>

About how people lived on over the years so close to the poles? In Antarctica, land that was cut off from everywhere else in the world? All through my expedition, I had had the opportunity to interact with many people who haven't visited Antarctica including school children and their teachers, Engineering students, newly joining employees of ISRO, IAS and IPS officers, members of various Ministries, Parliamentary Committees, Outstanding and Distinguished scientists of ISRO including current and former chairmen of the organization and the Honorable Vice President of India.

And we could see 2 pisten bullys approaching us and their station, Showa. The Japanese friends brought us some tea and steamed sweet bun which i think is a Japanese dessert, Anman. And we shared our paranthas with them. We took off after refueling and after about 4 hours, we were at Progress runway situated @10km distance from Bharati. Friends from Bharati were already waiting for us. As we proceeded to our new home, I had the opportunity of my...</p><a href="/2019/06/29/arrival-at-bharati.html">read more</a></div>

It is made of 134 prefabricated containers. The station broadly has 2 floors. The ground floor has laboraties for summer scientists to do the lab work and store the collected samples, a store room for equipment, 3 generators, workshop, garage, 2 entrances each towards East and West, dangri room where the dangris and shoes are left, food store, compacting room, RO area and store for station systems related equipment.

For, now the team is led by a different leader. And we too, marked the beginning of 37th ISEA. New team, new energy and budding friendships. I had a new female companion, our doctor, Dr. Sejal who is here with her doctor husband. The new team was busy with their handover but we made friends and went out together with whatever time we had. And just after a few days, it was my birthday. There were no ingredients for a regular cake, so I had a cake...</p><a href="/2019/07/20/New-Team-and-Celebrations-Copy.html">read more</a></div>

The ship was making progress in the fast ice. By the night of 27th, a message has already been received that the ship has made considerable progress and might moor close to the island by next morning. I was in night shift and kept curiously walking up to the interspace and looking at the sea trying to find he ship. After a few such trips, at around 02:00 AM Bharati time, I saw the ship at a corner behind another island. I was...</p><a href="/2019/07/27/The-ship.html">read more</a></div>

And then we could see that the members who waved goodbyes few hours ago, were walking back to the station with their bags. It would be a total of ~80 members in the station now, apart from the heli crew members. But bharati is designed with 24 living modules which can accomodate 2 people at once. So how could we all accomodate ourselves in bharati? With prompt response from leaders and officials, we utilized all the space we had, including lounge,...</p><a href="/2019/09/01/The-ship-2.html">read more</a></div>

Some of us, watching the sea and icebergs from the station, found something unusual. We saw something that looked like a line of ants on the Sea. And to our surprise, the line was moving. We knew who it could possibly be. But we needed a closer look. We had no binoculars. The closest we had was a camera with 35x optical zoom. We looked through the camera and concluded that we guessed...</p><a href="/2020/04/26/Bye-Bye-Sun.html">read more</a></div>
