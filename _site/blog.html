And down the journey, we started to see some little structures in white and blue shine on the sea. We were wondering what they were until we realized they were icebergs. Then came more ice and then, an announcement, we have 1.5 hour before landing and got to gear up to step on ice. 1 hour before landing, everyone started wearing their polar gears, all excited for what lay ahead. The polar gear is not an easy dressup, particularly for first timers. I...</p><a href="http://localhost:4000/2019/06/16/from-novo-to-maitri.html">read more</a></div>

And we could see 2 pisten bullys approaching us and their station, Showa. The Japanese friends brought us some tea and steamed sweet bun which i think is a Japanese dessert, Anman. And we shared our paranthas with them. We took off after refueling and after about 4 hours, we were at Progress runway situated @10km distance from Bharati. Friends from Bharati were already waiting for us. As we proceeded to our new home, I had the opportunity of my...</p><a href="http://localhost:4000/2019/06/29/arrival-at-bharati.html">read more</a></div>
