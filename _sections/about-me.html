<p style="text-align: left">Welcome to my place. I never knew I would make and maintain something like this until one day, I decided to. And after an expedition to Antarctica, seeing curiosity and the so many questions from people around me, I decided to bring into reality something I always only thought of, penning down my experiences for the world.<br>
    I once read that "Words are inert. People only understand what their meaning of the words they listen is" But, words have the power to take you into a world of directed imagination. <br>
    Explore the little world of mine through the my words and your imagination.</p>
