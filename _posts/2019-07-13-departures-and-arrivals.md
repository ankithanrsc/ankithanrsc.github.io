<p>Where were we last week? <br>

. . . . .<br>

Oh yeah!! On our first ever outing. And I should say, IT WAS SNOWONDERFUL! There was lots of snow everywhere and we had the slightest idea where we were stepping and going. I was already kindof confused from where we started and where we were headed. But we had members of 36ISEA accompanying us. I was already in love with snow, particularly fresh snow. As the name goes, it feels (and smells) so fresh that now when I remember it, I just want to make a snowball and have it.</p>  

<p>In the days to come, we had more opportunities we used to visit Bharati top, PB point and around. While our days went like this, there were others with whole other set of thoughts and emotions going on. The ones for whom Bharati had been home for more than a year, a home that adopted and taught them, where they spent the long nights, where they cherished the little things, where all the debates happened and with the friends they had those wonderful memories, who are about to leave this home to their homes. The ones who haven’t been with their family since an year, who never got to hold their newborn babies, who missed their sibling(s)’ wedding, who never saw the girl they would marry except on video call, who longed to meet their girl/boyfriend, who missed playing with their kids, who missed their hometown and its special flavors, who missed #gharKaKhana, who missed their support and strength by side, who missed innocent smiles that made everything worth the effort, who couldn’t have been there to support their parents, who couldn’t see their loved ones for one last time.... There is a lot going on in a single mind and heart. And a lot more in all those.</p>  

<p>Amidst all these, they have all successfully transferred the responsibilities to respective relievers. Now they are almost packed for return. The travel from Bharati to home is similar to the journey from home to Bharati except you go home directly from Capetown... Bharati > (feeder flight) > Maitri > (IL or Boeing or others) > Capetown > (intl. Flight) > (domestic flight/bus/train if needed) > HOME. Now the team is waiting for the feeder flight to come to Progress runway. And there is another team at Maitri, waiting for the same feeder flight to take them to Progress runway, and that will be the second part of 37ISEA-BH team arriving at Bharati.</p>

<p>Did I ever tell you how we generally wait for flight, particularly feeder? No? So, we know that its soon. And there is a tentative schedule always subject to changes at any moment of time. We wait for some information, any information on the flight departure/arrival. And we hear some speculations about the dates. We go through weather predictions for the coming week at both ends and possible fuel refilling halts. We match the results with the dates we got from the speculations and come up with our own dates. And we prepare accordingly. Then there is a news, the feeder has left for another station in the meanwhile because apparently, the weather on that route favored earlier than the weather on our route. So? Crash all the analysis made so far. Wait for the feeder to update the schedule on where its headed to next? Back to the original place or somewhere else? And when you finally know the next trip would be to Bharati, get back to analysis.</p> 

<p>Amidst all the emotions, waiting, postponement and waiting again, one fine day, it was time for the feeder to depart from Maitri with the team waiting there. When we got news of departure, everything seemed in such a hurry because we had a farewell party arranged for 36ISEA team, they had packing to do among other things. And in a few hours, our team has landed at Progress runway, received by a team awaiting their arrival, and reached Bharati. The farewell was over by then, and all the members greeted each other that night, for, the next morning, would be time for departure. The team of 10 that arrived included 8 winter members (2 doctors, 4 station engineers from <a href="http://techbeansystems.com/">Techbean systems</a>, 1 bro member, 1 deal member (communication officer)) and 2 summer members from Techbean systems who maintain the life support systems of station. And the departing team was 16/24 members of 36ISEA Bharati. The 4 station engineers, 1 doctor, 1 deal member, 2 vehicle team members were to stay back with us.</p>

<p>The next morning, we waved goodbyes to happy but sad and excited but emotional members. The just arrived members might also be excited like we were when we came. And with a change in team, there is always a change in the surroundings and environment. We shall explore that next week. </p>
